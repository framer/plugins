A collection of Framer Plugins. Try out the current selection of plugins on the [plugin branch](https://features-plugin.beta.framer.com/projects/) or try building a plugin of your own.

## Making Plugins

View the [plugin template repo](https://github.com/framer/plugin) to get started building a plugin. If you hack on something youâ€™d like us to include in our batch of example plugins, please feel free to open a PR.

## Feedback

We are early in the process of plugins, but moving fast! We appreciate any and all feedback in the [#proj-plugins](https://framer-team.slack.com/archives/C06L5H5ADK2) channel on Slack.
